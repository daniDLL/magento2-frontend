## Overview

The Magento application enables you to localize your store for multiple regions and markets. We improved the localization and customization of Magento instances by making translation dictionaries easier to update and by maintaining a reduced amount of code coupling and duplication.

A translation dictionary is a comma-separated value (.csv) file with at least two columns: the original phrase in the en_US locale and a translation of that phrase in an another locale. Sample translation from English (en_US) to German (de_DE):

```csv
"Add to Cart","Zum Warenkorb hinzufügen"
"Add to Compare","Hinzufügen um zu vergleichen"
"Add to Wishlist","Zum Wunschzettel hinzufügen"
"Additional Product Info","Zusätzliche Angaben zum Produkt"
"Address","Adresse"
"Address %1 of %2","Adresse %1 von %2"
```

## Practice

> Create a custom csv that contains the translations of our Teachers and Students module.

> To change Store language for testing purpose go to `Stores > Configuration > General > General > Locale Options > Locale`.
